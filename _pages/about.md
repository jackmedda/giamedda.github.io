Hi there! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page), Italy, working on the project *Promoting Healthy and Sustainable Eating through Interactive and Explainable AI Methods (PHaSE)* (PRIN 2022). My research interests revolve around the theme of responsible AI (fairness, explainability, robustness) in recommender systems and speaker recognition, with a particular focus on how these technologies can impact end-users.

In my work, I explore how machine learning algorithms can be designed to reduce bias and ensure that recommendations are fair and unbiased for all users. I am also interested in the development of speaker recognition technologies that are capable of accurately identifying and verifying the identity of users, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, or accent.

These aspects involve not only analyzing the extent of unfairness affecting a model (such as a recommender system or automatic speaker recognition system) but also mitigating the issue and providing explanations for the observed unfair outcomes.

I received my Ph.D. (summa cum laude) in Mathematics and Computer Science from [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page) in 2024.

I received my Master's degree (summa cum laude) in Computer Science from [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page) in 2020 before beginning my Ph.D. studies in the same year.

I have published in top-tier conferences (CIKM 2023, ECIR 2022, Interspeech 2021) and journals (IPM, Pattern Recognition Letters). I have served as a reviewer for conferences (ECIR 2024), workshops (BIAS 2023, KaRS 2023), and journals (Neural Processing Letters, TOIS).
