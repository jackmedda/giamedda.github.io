Hi there! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page), Italy, advised by [Dr. Mirko Marras](https://www.mirkomarras.com/), [Dr. Ludovico Boratto](https://www.ludovicoboratto.com/), [Prof. Gianni Fenu](https://unica.it/unica/en/ateneo_s07_ss01.page?contentId=SHD30371). My research interests revolve around the theme of fairness in recommender systems and speaker recognition, with a particular focus on how these technologies can impact end-users.

In my work, I explore how machine learning algorithms can be designed to reduce bias and ensure that recommendations are fair and unbiased for all users. I am also interested in the development of more robust speaker recognition technologies that are capable of accurately identifying and verifying the identity of users, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, or accent.

I received my Master's degree (summa cum laude) in Computer Science from [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page) before beginning my Ph.D. studies.
